First I start to recherche witch chip I will use as processor for the Keyboard and chose the STM32F411CCU.

After I chose the Chip I search eater I use fixed switches or I make the switches changeable. I decide for the changeable version.

After I decide this things, I research how I make the Switches changeable, and found the MX100H (CPG151101S11)

Then I make the Key-Matrix
